This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting health insurance charges using linear regression. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes various libraries including pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

The main steps of the code include:

Importing the necessary libraries and reading the dataset from a CSV file.
Printing the first and last few rows of the dataset to get an overview.
Generating descriptive statistics of the dataset using the describe() function.
Checking for null values in the dataset and dropping rows with missing values.
Grouping the data by 'sex' and 'smoker' columns and creating a stacked bar plot.
Calculating the correlation between numeric values in the dataset and displaying the correlation matrix.
Splitting the dataset into input features and the target variable, performing one-hot encoding on categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Creating an instance of the LinearRegression model, fitting it to the training data, and making predictions on the test set.
Printing the predicted charges.
Creating a scatter plot to compare the actual charges and predicted charges.
The code provides a comprehensive analysis of health insurance charges, including exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and prediction evaluation. The scatter plot visually compares the actual and predicted charges, allowing for an assessment of the model's performance.

This repository serves as a useful resource for anyone interested in understanding and predicting health insurance charges using linear regression.
